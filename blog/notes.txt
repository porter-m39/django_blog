Sunday, Feb 2

Today, my nav bar is not working. I'm not sure why.
I remember getting the "default image" feature working last week, but it doesn't seem to be working today.
For now, taking a break from getting images to work. Some good, concrete goals for this week are:
- Fix navigation bar
- Try to set up website as you would want your personal website to look
- Then, start over and make a personal website
